    <!-- PROFESSIONAL SELF-ASSESSMENT -->

      <h1>Professional Self-Assessment</h1>
      <p>
        My name is <strong>Andre Espinoza</strong>. I have been working toward my Computer Science
        degree for about six years total, starting with my associate&apos;s and then finishing this
        bachelor&apos;s at SNHU. It has not been a straight line. PTSD and knee injuries from my
        time in the military slowed me down and hit my performance more than once, but I stayed with
        it. I have been at SNHU for around two years, and this capstone is the last class before I
        graduate, so this ePortfolio is basically my Gear 5 Luffy moment from my favorite show One Piece
        where everything I learned finally comes together in one place.
      </p>
      <p>
        The most important things I have taken from this program are learning how to build full stack
        applications with modern tools, how to think algorithmically instead of just hacking things
        together, and how to approach every project with a security mindset. The Travlr Getaways
        project ended up being the main artifact where I pulled all of that together. I refactored it
        into a cleaner, more secure full stack app with JSON Web Token authentication, full role-based
        access control, a simple recommendation algorithm for trips, and a real booking flow backed
        by MongoDB.
      </p>
      <p>
        This ePortfolio is here to show that I can design, build, and explain a complete system from
        frontend to backend. It highlights how I think about structure, data, security, and real
        users, not just grades. The code review, enhancement narratives, and database work all tie
        back to the main CS program outcomes by showing that I can communicate clearly, design
        solutions with trade-offs in mind, and deliver software that feels ready for real use, not
        just a class assignment.

    <!-- ARTIFACTS OVERVIEW -->
    <section id="artifacts">
      <h2>Artifacts and Enhancements</h2>
      <p>
        For this capstone I focused on one main artifact, the <strong>Travlr Getaways</strong> web
        application from CS 465. It is a MEAN stack project that started as a basic travel booking
        site and then became the core place where I applied three different enhancement paths:
        software engineering and design, algorithms and data structures, and databases.
      </p>

      <!-- Software Engineering & Design -->
      <article class="card">
        <h3>Software Engineering and Design</h3>
        <p>
          Originally, the backend exposed public CRUD operations on trips with minimal validation.
          I implemented JSON Web Token authentication and role-based access control so only admins
          can modify trip data.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the server, <code>requireAuth</code> verifies the JWT and
          <code>requireRole('admin')</code> protects POST, PUT, and DELETE routes for trips. Missing
          or invalid tokens return a 401 response, while valid tokens with insufficient privileges
          return a 403 forbidden response.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the Angular client, an HTTP interceptor automatically attaches the Bearer token to API
          requests. An AuthGuard enforces role-based routing, and the UI hides admin-only actions
          unless the authenticated user has the admin role. This separation of concerns mirrors
          real-world production patterns and keeps the codebase secure and maintainable.
        </p>
      </article>

      <!-- Algorithms & Data Structures -->
      <article class="card">
        <h3>Algorithms and Data Structures</h3>
        <p>
          In the original version, trips were returned in an unranked list. I added a simple
          recommendation algorithm that scores trips based on user preferences such as budget,
          continent, category, and desired trip length.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each trip is assigned a score, and the list is sorted using an
          <code>O(n log n)</code> sort. Trips that best match the user’s preferences are displayed
          first. This approach balances performance, clarity, and explainability without
          overengineering the solution.
        </p>
        <p>
          This enhancement demonstrates algorithmic thinking, trade-off analysis, and the ability
          to design efficient solutions appropriate to the scale of the application.
        </p>
      </article>

      <!-- Databases -->
      <article class="card">
        <h3>Databases</h3>
        <p>
          The database enhancement focused on adding a booking system with capacity enforcement.
          Trips now include a capacity field, and bookings link users to specific trips.
        </p>
        <p>
          The booking flow uses a single atomic
          <code>findOneAndUpdate</code> operation that checks available capacity and decrements it in
          one step. Successful bookings return a 201 response with updated capacity, while
          overbooking attempts return a 409 conflict without modifying data.
        </p>
        <p>
          This design protects data integrity, prevents race conditions, and demonstrates proper
          use of database constraints in concurrent environments.

      <h2>Informal Code Review</h2>
      <p>
        This video walks through the original Travlr Getaways codebase, highlights design and
        security issues, and explains how the final enhancements improved the system across all
        three focus areas.
