# Andre Espinoza – CS 499 Computer Science Capstone ePortfolio

This repository contains my CS 499 Computer Science Capstone ePortfolio for Southern New Hampshire University.

The ePortfolio presents my final capstone work, including my professional self-assessment, enhanced artifacts, informal code review, screenshots, and supporting documentation. It is designed to show how my skills developed across the Computer Science program and how those skills come together in a complete, real-world style system.
